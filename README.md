This repository contains replication materials for *The Role of Liquidity in Food Choice: Evidence from the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008* by [Z. Goodman](https://zagoodman.com).

## Paper Overview

In this paper ** estimate the effect of the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 (ESA) on nutritional choice. Specifically, I exploit the quasi-random timing of receipt of the ESA tax rebates as a natural experiment to examine how a one-time, lump sum payment impacts food choice. ESA tax rebates, generally around $1200 for a two-person household plus $300 per child, were mailed on a date depending on the last two digits of the primary filer's Social Security number, which are assigned as good as randomly.

Using data from the Nielsen Consumer Panel, a supplemental survey, and a nutrition database, I can observe nutrient purchases by households over time as well as when they receive their ESA tax rebates. I use a stacked event-study approach to estimate the effect of receiving the ESA rebate on nutrient consumption.

## Preview of findings

* Receipt of the ESA rebate significantly increases food purchases for households without liquidity by 10% but has little effect on households with liquidity
* Over the month following receipt of the rebate, the increase in calories purchased can be explained 70% by sugar but only 2% by fiber, 4% by protein, and 6% by starch, suggesting that the rebate may have decreased nutritional quality.
* Receipt of ESAs increases both probability of purchasing alcohol and volume of alcohol purchased
